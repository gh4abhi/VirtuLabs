<h1>The problem VirtuLabs solve</h1>
Ever since the pandemic hit, we humans have accustomed to our mundane work-life and activities, thus we were inspired to bring you our hack VirtuLabs. We have noticed that education suffered a lag in these 2-3 years due to the pandemic. Though, our dedicated and hard-working teachers left no stone unturned to teach their students even in these times. We are trying to help our teachers by gifting them an asset in form of VirtuLabs. It is our way of combining visualization made possible through Augmented Reality(AR) and education. It can act as a tool for teachers in online classes to improve interaction, which is somewhat lost in virtual mediums. Students learn anytime, anywhere at the mere click of a button, and we have been introduced by our team to supplement laboratory education in this covid-stricken era. It is known to us that there is n number of online simulators available today but they somehow lack the real-life experience, which we have tried to restore in our app.

This app as contemplated and created by our team members also serves a socio-welfare purpose. We have combined all the plugins, scenes, and sections of our app and presented it in a form of an android application that can be installed anytime and anywhere with any plane surface to start your learning. This app can be an asset to teachers in rural areas and government schools, where resources are limited. It serves two purposes, first they will understand the concepts better through 3d models and animation. And the second one is, maybe many of the students are inspired by seeing these burgeoning technologies and develop an interest in them. Moreover, there is no need for a network connection for our app, which is a major problem in rural areas. As we always say "Padhega India, Tabhi to Badhega India", our development is an ode to this tagline.

Even if our development benefits a single child or learner out there.
<h1>Challenges we ran into</h1>
Deciding on the components as such was easy, but implementing them was not a cakewalk. We brainstormed for various hours figuring out the plugins that were to be used. A hell lot of time was invested in fixing the bugs in our code as the experimental procedure was based on it. We had to make sure if the user violates the order of the experiment, it would
show an error then and there and the experiment has to be restarted. And construct a system where the progress of children could be monitored by their teachers virtually was also challenging. But we are glad we managed to finish and put up all the components in the end.
